# MyReads Project

Myreads is an app that helps you to search books and categorize them into three book shelves: 
- Currently reading
- Want to read 
- Read 

You can search books by title or author. 

You can see the demo here:

This is the first of three projects required by the Udacity's React Nanodegree program.
