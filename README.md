# MyReads Project

Myreads is an app that helps you to find books and categorize them in three categories: 
- Currently reading
- Want to read 
- Read 

You can see the demo here:
https://myreadsbyanalin.netlify.app/search/

It's the first of three projects required by the Udacity's React Nanodegree program. 

## TL;DR
You can clone the repository, use NPM to install the dependencies and start the development server. 

$ git clone https://github.com/anaesperanzalin/myreads2
$ cd reactnd-project-myreads
$ npm install
$ npm start 

You can view the project in your browser at http://localhost:3000 

Thank you for taking time to view my project!
